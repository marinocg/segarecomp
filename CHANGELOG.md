# Changelog

Releases are published on the [Releases](../../releases) page. This file records what changed between them. Per-game and per-feature status is in the
[compatibility ledger](docs/product/compatibility-ledger.md); the operator checklist for cutting the next release is [docs/product/release-readiness.md](docs/product/release-readiness.md).

## Unreleased (on `main` since v0.7.0, DRAFT release notes)

> Draft for the next release. The version number and the publication are the operator's decision; nothing here has been tagged or published.

### Widescreen (new)

* A shared, presentation-only widescreen setting for Genesis, Master System and Sega CD: **Original**, **Extended Backgrounds (Level 2)** and **Enhanced Widescreen (Level 3)**, with a **Widescreen Width** slider from 4:3 to 16:9,
  **Comfort / Borders / Raw Extension** side treatments and per-game saved settings, all changeable live from the pause menu and the launcher settings.
* Honest capability reporting: Level 2/3 are often **Partial**. Master System's extra columns repeat scenery already on screen; Level 3 draws only sprites the game already submits and does not make a game create objects outside its original window.
* A program built with an earlier release keeps playing in Original and needs a rebuild to gain widescreen.

### Game patches and the native patch SDK (new, Genesis)

* `.segapatch` packages: **schema 1** (verified data-only BPS) and **schema 2** (a **trusted native C11 provider**, optionally with BPS), installed from a game's **Patches / Variants** card as a separate **Patched** variant beside **Vanilla**.
* A small public **provider SDK** (`segarecomp_genesis_patch.h`, ABI 1) lets a package reconstruct scenery from the game's own data and redraw its original HUD. The SDK header, its documents and a synthetic sample ship in the release package under `sdk/`.
* Packages are bound to the exact game image and the exact approved package identity. Native patches are **executable code, not sandboxed**; hashes prove integrity, not authorship or safety.
* Game-specific packages (Sonic 1, Sonic 2, Sonic 3 & Knuckles, Streets of Rage 2) are maintained outside this repository, are **not included in this release**, and are described in the ledger; the maintainer states their extended scenery and widescreen were independently validated in all levels.

### Save states, game saves and rewind (new, Genesis; ADR 0278)

* **Automatic game saves:** a Genesis cartridge's SRAM or X24C01 EEPROM is kept between sessions, written when you end the session (Return to Launcher / Quit / close the window) and never after a crash, a typed stop or an instruction limit. Saves live in the library (`saves/genesis/<image sha256>/vanilla|patches/<id>/`), separate for a patched version, and survive rebuilds, cache cleanup and removing the game from the library.
* **Save states:** *Save State* / *Load State* in the pause menu (five numbered slots with a picture and play time each, confirmation before overwriting or loading), **F5** / **F8** for a quick slot. A state is the whole machine, including the sound chips; loading continues sample for sample. A failed save never damages the previous state; a failed load never changes the running game; a state from another game, version, region or build is refused with the reason.
* **Rewind (F7 or the pause menu):** browse the last ten minutes of play as pictures on a timeline (a moment every 10 seconds, 60 in all, in memory only, at most 96 MiB), pick a moment and continue from it; cancelling changes nothing. Gamepad (both triggers held, shoulders, south / east buttons), keyboard and mouse all work.
* Master System and Sega CD show the new menu rows disabled with the reason; the Sega CD backup RAM behaves as before. See [docs/product/save-states.md](docs/product/save-states.md) for the guarantees and limits.

### Genesis

* Automatic recognition of the Sonic & Knuckles lock-on cartridge images (exact header contents only; manual override in Advanced build options; `--mapper lock_on` on the command line).
* Opt-in `--z80-static 1` for `segarecomp build`: reconstructs provable Genesis Z80 images before the first Z80 compilation (ADR 0277). Off by default, not exposed in the launcher, not a guarantee for any title.
* Optimized AOT evaluation for cartridges that run code from RAM thunks, and static RAM `JMP` thunks (ADR 0270, 0272). The changed interrupt-delivery behavior of the latter has no independent Genesis-level reference.

### Performance and diagnostics

* **F3** performance overlay (Off / Player / Developer), profiling reports and benchmark tools (ADR 0273).
* Throughput work (ADR 0275, 0276): measured on one development host, the software-rendered viewer ran about 20% faster unthrottled and builds were about 10-14% faster. Guest behavior and frames are unchanged. These are not guarantees on other machines.

### Documentation

* The README, platform pages and Sega CD notes now describe what is actually implemented (generated-native Genesis Z80, Master System, Sega CD audio and saves, key remapping) and how strong the evidence is.
  Human-reported completions of Sonic CD and Earthworm Jim Special Edition are recorded as **maintainer-reported**, not as independently validated runs.

### Known limitations

* Compatibility is not universal; unsupported behavior stops with a typed diagnostic.
* Sega CD: complete CUE-to-play compilation is not claimed; FM/PSG output is not reference-checked.
* Genesis is a three-button pad; PAL runs at 60 Hz.
* The full patch-to-executable build test runs on Linux CI only; Windows and macOS validate compilation of the SDK sample, packaging and the launcher.
* Packages are not signed or notarized. macOS needs right-click > Open on first launch; Linux needs glibc 2.35 or newer.

## v0.7.0 (2026-11-01)

Sega CD becomes an interactive platform in the launcher: authentic BIOS execution, Sonic CD playable, shared viewer with input recording and replay, self-service and File-first builds, CD-DA, RF5C164 PCM,
main-side Z80 with FM/PSG, persistent internal backup RAM and unified launcher integration. See the [release page](../../releases/tag/v0.7.0).
